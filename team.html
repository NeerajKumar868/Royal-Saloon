        <h1>TAKASHI MATONO (DIRECTOR)</h1><br>
        <p>In Japan, Takashi spent 8 years studying, perfecting, and improving his techniques at a prestigious salon
          called Peek A Boo.<br> After relocating to New York in 2002, his next stage of development was at
          Warren-Tricomi, where he trained directly with Edward Tricomi,<br> benefitting from his mentorship in
          developing his craft, and then with the world renown hair stylist, Didier Malige.<br>

          Takashi has taken the lessons learned to heart and uniquely infused them<br> together with his own distinctive
          style of hair design. The results led to the formation of an artist who is, not only known for being <br>a
          risk taker, but a hair designer whose creations have earned him the praises and trust of his peers and clients
          alike.

        <h1>MICHELLE (STYLIST)</h1><br>
        <p>
          Hair is her life. Michelle always had a passion for hair styling. Michelle was so determined to start her
          future in hair that only a month after graduating high school she started classes at the local Paul Mitchell
          cosmetology school. While in cosmetology school, she participated in an intense workshop in Las Vegas with
          Master Stylists, such as Angus Mitchell, Robert Cromeans, Jason Reyes and many more. These Stylists inspired
          her to become creative with her new found craft and never give up on her dreams. As an apprentice of a former
          Vidal Sassoon creative director, she continued her education and refined the techniques of precision styling.
          Michelle soon realized her dream was to work in a top salon in New York City.
